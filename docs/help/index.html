<h2>About</h2>

<p>This piece of software is designed to let a DJ get his job
done more
easily. You can easily manage your collection of Vinyls, Cds, Mp3s and
save and visualize possible transitions between these tracks. The
intention of this software is to let you plan your sets, and keep cool
transitions in mind while playing around with music. With DJBrain your
live set will never run out into dead ends and you will always have a
track that perfectly fits into your set!</p>

<h2>Import / Export</h2>
